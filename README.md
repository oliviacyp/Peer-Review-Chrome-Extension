# Peer-Review-Chrome-Extension

This is a very simple project for us to get acquainted with the process of developing Google Chrome Extensions. This extension can be used on any web page but works best on articles and journals. If there is any warning on the page that suggests the article has not been peer reviewed, an alert will pop up on the webpage. The goal of this extension is to help people do a quick and surface-level check to reduce the spread of misinformation.
